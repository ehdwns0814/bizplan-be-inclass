# PROJECT OVERVIEW: Coached Backend Service

## Vision
To provide a robust, scalable, and secure backend infrastructure for the "Coached" AI-powered running coach application, enabling user data persistence, cross-device synchronization, and advanced analytics (Post-MVP features).

## Core Features
- **User Management**: Authentication, profile management, and secure identity handling.
- **Data Synchronization**: Cloud storage for running analysis results (JSON/Metrics).
- **Event Processing**: Asynchronous processing of analysis events for future advanced insights.
- **Notification Service**: Push notifications for user engagement and re-analysis reminders.

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: Mobile App (iOS) clients consuming APIs.
- **Secondary**: Admin/Data Analysts monitoring system performance and user metrics.

## Project Goals
- **Scalability**: Support increasing concurrent user requests with low latency.
- **Reliability**: Ensure high availability and data consistency using Saga patterns for distributed transactions.
- **Security**: Protect user health data with industry-standard encryption and auth protocols.

## Success Metrics
- **API Latency**: P99 < 200ms for core endpoints.
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability.
- **Data Integrity**: Zero data loss in pipeline processing.

## Project Philosophy
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns (Domain, Application, Infrastructure).
- **Event-Driven**: Utilizing Kafka for decoupled service interactions.
- **Test-Driven**: Comprehensive testing (Unit, Integration, E2E) with Testcontainers.
- **Documentation First**: API-first design using OpenAPI/Swagger.
